<h5>Project Description:</h5>
<p>Using functions, arrays, and objects within two Ajax functions and event listeners in the global scope, we created an app that allows the user to search for recipes by a single key term like an ingredient. The user has an option of limiting their search with the available dietary restrictions. When searched, that ingredient will return a total of ten responses with an image and a complete list of ingredients. Afterwards, the user will be able to either click on the recipe div itself to redirect to the source of the recipe or search for a YouTube video that is LIKE but NOT the recipe returned. The YouTube will return a total of five thumbnails to choose from which, when clicked on, will redirect the user to the YouTube page itself. </p>
