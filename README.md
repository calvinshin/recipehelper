<h3>Project Description:</h3>
<p>Using functions, arrays, and objects within two Ajax functions and event listeners in the global scope, we created an app that allows the user to search for recipes by a single key term like an ingredient. The user has an option of limiting their search with the available dietary restrictions. When searched, that ingredient will return a total of ten responses with an image and a complete list of ingredients. Afterwards, the user will be able to either click on the recipe div itself to redirect to the source of the recipe or search for a YouTube video that is LIKE but NOT the recipe returned. The YouTube will return a total of eight thumbnails to choose from which, when clicked on, will redirect the user to the YouTube page itself. </p>

<h3>Roles:</h3>
<p><u>Calvin:</u><br>
    Calvin worked as the engineering PM for the project, making sure that all team members grew and developed their coding skills while working on this project. To ensure this, Calvin wrote less code and instead provided pseudocode to ensure that the code would merge together correctly. The core work was to be a primary code reviewer and correct any outstanding issues after code was pushed.

    For this project I began by researching and obtaining the first set of API keys that were needed.** I then created an ajax call for the YouTube API and compiled the responses that were necessary for our app. I also created an event listener and it's corresponding attributes within the cardmaker function that would allow the videos to display thumbnails and direct it to play.
